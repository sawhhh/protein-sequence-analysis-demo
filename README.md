# Protein Sequence Analysis Demo
## Project Overview
This is a computational biology demonstration project that performs protein sequence similarity analysis and phylogenetic tree construction across multiple species.
## Key Results

## Methodology
1. Data Simulation: Created a similarity matrix for Cytochrome C protein across five species.
2. Distance Calculation: Converted similarity scores to evolutionary distances.
3. Phylogenetic Analysis: Constructed evolutionary relationships using hierarchical clustering principles.
4. Visualization: Generated heatmap and phylogenetic tree visualizations.

## How to Run
\`\`\`bash
python protein_analysis.py
\`\`\`
